### Overview

You’ve already worked in small groups to accomplish various labs and exercises, but this time **we’re going to challenge you to work on a whole project with a small team.**

Not only will you be asked to **exercise additional creativity** in designing your own project, your instructors will partner you with other classmates to architect, design, and collaboratively build an application of your own design.

**This is meant to push you both technically and collaboratively.** It’s a lot harder to work in a team than to work by yourself, but that's most likely what you'll be doing in your first development job after WDI, and **it's important to learn how to work together.**

Make it work, and make it awesome.

### Premise: Startup in a Week

Your team has been put together in order to create a startup around a particular idea. In one week, you're expected to flesh out your ideas as a group and create a MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Since you'll be answering to investors (the class and your instructors), keep the following in mind:

* What is your application (elevator pitch, ideally in one sentence)
* What value does your application provide to your audience?
* What steps have you taken to entice users? (user experience, a fancy frontend, trying out functionality before being forced to signup)

---

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Use Ruby on Rails and Active Record** to build an application
* **Create an application using at least 2 related models**, one of which should be a user
* Include **all major CRUD functions** for at least one of those models
* **Craft thoughtful user stories together**, as a team
* **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using a standard Git flow on Github
* Layout and style your front-end with **clean & well-formatted CSS**, with or without a framework.
* **Deploy your application online** so it's publically accessible




Your app should also have:

* Create your own front-end with HTML & Javascript
* **Add authentication** to restrict access to appropriate users

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working app, built by the whole team**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **team git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project.
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with:
    * Explanations of the **technologies** used
    * A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    * Link to your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
    * Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
    * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to overcome

---

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / APIs you use** In fact, you should most likely tackle your APIs first.
* **Write your code DRY** and **build your app to be RESTful**.
* **Be consistent with your code style.** Use the ruby styleguide. You're working in teams, but you're only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.

* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

### Feedback + Evaluation
The project is meant to demonstrate that everyone is minimally capable of __applying__ the things we saw during class.

Given __Bloom's Taxonomy__ students should be able to apply their knowledge of Rails, MVC, CRUD and Active Record. Students must remember enough of the concepts to to understand how to apply their knowledge / build this project.
